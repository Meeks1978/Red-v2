# Memory Doctrine (Phase-5)

Memory is infrastructure, not intelligence.

## Scopes
- **Canonical**: approved truth, doctrine, invariants
- **Operational**: events, receipts, world state
- **Semantic**: recall only, never authoritative

## Rules
- Canonical writes require explicit approval
- Semantic memory may not drive execution
- Memory failure must not block execution
- Every item must carry provenance + trace_id
